# zsh shell configuration

To install:

- Run `link.sh` in the parent directory to point zsh to this dir via `.zshenv`
- Run: `brew install asdf`
- Run `./install-ohmyzsh-YYYYMMDD.sh` to install ohmyzsh to default location (in home dir)

Restart terminal to source changes.

Repo must be checked out to `~/src/compy-config` for zsh configuration to work as expected.
